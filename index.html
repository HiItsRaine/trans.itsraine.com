          <p>Surprise, I'm transgender!</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">But what does that actually mean?</p>
          <p>Well, the best way I can describe being transgender is basically that who you are on the outside doesn't match who you are on the inside.</p>
          <p>Here's Wikipedia's definition of transgender (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender</a>):</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender">
            A transgender (often shortened to trans) person has a gender identity different from that typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. [that's me!] The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned sex.
          </blockquote>
          <p>That's right, sex and gender are different things. So while I am of the male sex, my gender is actually something else. (I'll get to what it is later; it's a bit complicated.)</p>
          <p>Being transgender (or trans, as I will refer to it from now on) is quite uncommon, and it's not known what causes it. According to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/genderidentity/bulletins/genderidentityenglandandwales/census2021">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/genderidentity/bulletins/genderidentityenglandandwales/census2021</a> approximately 0.5% of the UK population who are 16+ are trans as of 2021, and 0.06% are non-binary.</p>
          <p>This is the trans flag:</p>
          <img src="/assets/Transgender_Pride_flag.svg" width="100" />
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">Non-binary? Oh no, not another new word...</p>
          <p>Yes, another new word. When you think of gender, you probably only think of male and female. However, there's more than just that. The word non-binary is used when your gender is neither male nor female.</p>
          <p>To properly explain what non-binary means I'm going to have to bring out <span class="font-bold">THE GENDER METER</span>.™ (Please keep in mind that this is purposely simplified for this explanation and may not fully represent everyone; gender is complicated.)</p>
          <p>Here it is:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
            ^</code></pre>
          <p>Gender is like a spectrum, and on this meter that spectrum is represented by a line going from M (male) to F (female). People who fall into the categories of male or female will be on either end of this meter.</p>
          <p>A man would be here on the meter:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
^</code></pre>
          <p>While a woman would be here on the meter:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
                        ^</code> </pre>
          <p>A non-binary person (also known as an "enby") could be somewhere else on the meter, for example, here:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
                  ^</code></pre>
          <p>Or here:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
          ^</code></pre>
          <p>This is the non-binary flag:</p>
          <img src="/assets/Nonbinary_flag.svg" width="100" />
          <br>
          <p>One of the many gender identities that falls under the non-binary umbrella is genderfluid.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">Genderfluid? Is that a new Pepsi Max flavour?</p>
          <p>Well, uh... no. No, it is not.</p>
          <p>Most people's gender remains constant throughout their life, but for a very small number of people, it can change over time.</p>
          <p>So one day, a genderfluid person may be on the left side of the gender meter, and the next day their gender may have shifted to be on the right side of the meter. How often, how fast, or how much a genderfluid person's gender changes is different for everyone.</p>
          <p>This is the genderfluid flag:</p>
          <img src="/assets/Genderfluidity_Pride-Flag.svg" width="100" />
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">Only two more gender identities, I promise</p>
          <p>What if someone feels partially male <span class="font-bold">and</span> partially another gender at the same time? "Whaaaaat?" I hear you say, but it's true, and it's called being a demiboy.</p>
          <p>Oh look, there's a flag for that too:</p>
          <img src="/assets/Demiboyflag.png" width="100" />
          <br>
          <p>"B-But... is there a female version of that?" I also hear you say, and to that I yell in return: "<span class="font-bold">OF COURSE THERE IS, SILLY, IT'S CALLED BEING A DEMIGIRL. BAM, HERE'S THE FLAG:</span>"</p>
          <img src="/assets/Demigirlflag.png" width="100" />
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">So what am I?</p>
          <p>Hooray, I'm resolving the mystery at the beginning of the page! (Wow, such good writing!)</p>
          <p>I am a genderfluid demigirl. Basically, this just means that I am genderfluid but my gender almost always remains within this area of the meter:</p>
          <pre class="text-lg">
            <code>
M                       F
|___________|___________|
            ^           ^
            |___________|</code></pre>
          <p>This is something that I have been thinking about and trying to figure out for over two years now, and I'm finally comfortable with who I am. To reflect this, my name is now Raine, and as such, please do not use my previous name anymore. Please also use she/her pronouns to refer to me from now on.</p>
          <p>If you don't understand it, that's okay, gender is complicated.</p>
          <p>I know it might sound silly, but this is who I am.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold underline">A few more things</p>
          <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>A huge thank you to my friends who already know about this for helping me through some very stressful times, giving me advice, and for helping me write this page, and thanks to you for (hopefully) reading this all the way to the end.</li>
            <li>Please do not ask me about this IRL; if you need to ask me a question send me a message instead. (This also applies to my parents.)</li>
            <li>"Why did you buy yet another domain?" I wanted a domain with my name in it and itsraine.com sounded cool and it's pretty short and easy to remember.</li>
